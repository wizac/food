byte[] image = File.ReadAllBytes("D:\\11.jpg");

SqlCommand sqlCommand = new SqlCommand("INSERT INTO imageTest (pic_id, pic) VALUES (1, @Image)", yourConnectionReference);
sqlCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Image", image);
sqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery();
Please bear in mind that your pic field will more than likely need to change data type. A common type for this information is VARBINARY.

The next part is reading the file into a PictureBox. For this, you'll need to SELECT the data out:

SqlDataAdapter dataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(new SqlCommand("SELECT pic FROM imageTest WHERE pic_id = 1", yourConnectionReference));
DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();
dataAdapter.Fill(dataSet);

if (dataSet.Tables[0].Rows.Count == 1)
{
    Byte[] data = new Byte[0];
    data = (Byte[])(dataSet.Tables[0].Rows[0]["pic"]);
    MemoryStream mem = new MemoryStream(data);
    yourPictureBox.Image= Image.FromStream(mem);
} 
And that should be about it. You might want to do better safety checks, but this should help you get started.
